# CryptoAggregator

## About

CryptoAggregator is a free, open source Crypto Aggregator. 

Those that do their taxes are forced to use online Crypto Aggregators that are pricy. The goal is to create 100% free tool. TurboTax Intuit has a hard limit on the number of transactions one can upload (2,000ish). As a result, they then basically force you over to 3rd party pricy crypto aggregators.

A tool was built!
As of right now, the tool will only help with Robinhood 2020 csv files. 
Use the output csv file and upload that instead to TurboTax Intuit
